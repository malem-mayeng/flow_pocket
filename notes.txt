  now it's september. or when october starts does the income/expece and
  all the list automally reset for new month?
  if not how can we have it.
  right above the income filed, can we have a very small month/year
  picker, which by default to this curent month, and when new month
  starts, it reset reset the expeses and income. and if we select previous
  month, it should bing up the records, likeincome, expece, recent for
  that month etc.
  note: recent and view all are month wise. not throiught all time
